<strong>Monterrey</strong> consists of a three-story continuous building
that in section superimposes a home (first floor) with a two-story apartment
above (2nd and 3rd story). Both units are designed to technically and
economically facilitate the final middle class standard of which we will hand
over the “first half” (40 m2). In this sense, the difficult parts of the house
(bathrooms, kitchen, stairs, and dividing walls) are designed for the expanded
scenario, that is, for a home of more than 58 m2 approx. and an apartment of
approximately 76 m2.
